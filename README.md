# covid-r-plots

## Welcome to my first Git repository!

Hi! You will find a couple of R scripts that I've been writing about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 (more notoriously known as *Coronavirus*).

I got the raw data from the [John's Hopkins University's repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and worked with it using `R`.

For now, this repo consists in one script reshaping the data as a ggplot-friendly dataframe and exporting it to .csv and another one to plot that same data.

> It ain't much, but it's honest work.

## Plots
